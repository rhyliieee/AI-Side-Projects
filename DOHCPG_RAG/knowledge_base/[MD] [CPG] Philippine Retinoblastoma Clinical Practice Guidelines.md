# Philippine Retinoblastoma Clinical Practice Guidelines

# Retinoblastoma Guideline Development Group

# August 2024
---
# Executive Summary

This CPG is a set of 10 key questions with 30 graded recommendations and three ungraded good practice statements on screening, diagnosis, referral and treatment of children with retinoblastoma. This guideline is intended to be used by clinicians in the primary healthcare setting and specialists in cancer centers. It may also serve as the basis for the DOH-approved standards of care and the development of the PhilHealth benefit package for retinoblastoma.

The guideline development process followed the framework developed by DOH, consisting of the following phases: Preparation, Evidence Generation, Appraisal and Implementation.1 The summary of recommendations for the CPG is summarized in Table 1.

The recommendations in this CPG shall hold and will be updated after 3 years or when new evidence arises.

# Table 1. Summary of recommendations for Retinoblastoma

|Recommendations|Strength of recommendations|Certainty of Evidence|
|---|---|---|
|Question 1: Among children with a family history of Retinoblastoma, will serial dilated fundus examination be acceptable towards early detection when genetic testing is not available?|Strong|Low|
|Among children with a family history of Rb, we recommend serial dilated fundus examination.| | |
|Question 2: Among children with suspicion of Retinoblastoma, what is the recommended work-up to accurately diagnose Retinoblastoma?| | |
|Among children with suspicion of Rb, we recommend to clinically diagnose based on comprehensive history, physical examination, and indirect ophthalmoscopy done by a capable ophthalmologist.|Strong|Low|
|Among children with suspicion of Rb, we recommend multidisciplinary discussions, imaging using ultrasound, cranial and orbital MRI with contrast or cranial and orbital CT scan.|Strong|Low|
|Question 3: Among children diagnosed with Retinoblastoma, what is the recommended work-up to accurately stage retinoblastoma?| | |
|Among children diagnosed with Rb, we recommend multidisciplinary team discussions and appropriate imaging done in experienced centers.|Strong|Low|
---
Among children diagnosed with Rb, we recommend ocular B scan 2D ultrasound and MRI or high-quality CT scan with contrast of the head and orbit for initial staging purposes.

Among children diagnosed with Rb, when MRI of the brain and orbit is available and accessible, we recommend its preference over CT scan of the brain and orbit with high quality contrast.

Among children diagnosed with Rb showing signs of extraocular disease, we suggest performing lumbar puncture and/or bone marrow examination for screening of metastasis.

# Question 4: Among intraocular Retinoblastoma patients on active ocular salvage therapy, what is the optimal timing of examination under anesthesia (EUA) to evaluate treatment response and disease status?

Among intraocular Rb patients on active ocular salvage therapy, we recommend EUA, evaluation of treatment response, and local consolidation therapy to be performed by an ophthalmologist on the scheduled day of chemotherapy delivery.

# Question 5: Among newly diagnosed children with intraocular Retinoblastoma, what are the indications for upfront enucleation and ocular salvage therapy?

# Upfront Enucleation

Among newly diagnosed children with intraocular Rb, we recommend that upfront enucleation be performed for ICRB Group E.

Among newly diagnosed children with intraocular Rb, we recommend that upfront enucleation be performed for ICRB Group D when the other eye is normal or Group A.

Among newly diagnosed children with intraocular Rb with no access to globe sparing modality or are at risk of poor follow up, we recommend that primary enucleation be relatively indicated. Primary enucleation is an option especially but not limited to unilateral Rb cases.

# Ocular Salvage Therapy

Among newly diagnosed children with intraocular Rb, we recommend ocular salvage therapy for ICRB Groups A, B, and C.
---
# Recommendations for Ocular Salvage Therapy in Retinoblastoma

# 1. Ocular Salvage Therapy for Bilateral Intraocular Rb

Among newly diagnosed children with BILATERAL, intraocular Rb, we recommend ocular salvage therapy for ICRB Group D eyes when it is the better of two eyes.

# 2. Ocular Salvage Therapy Access

Among newly diagnosed children with intraocular Rb, we recommend against ocular salvage therapy when there is lack of access and availability to globe sparing modalities (chemotherapy and local therapy such as laser and cryotherapy) or risk of poor follow-up.

# 3. Ocular Salvage Therapy with Recalcitrant Rb Seeds

Among Rb patients undergoing ocular salvage therapy with recalcitrant or residual vitreous or anterior chamber Rb seeds, we recommend intravitreal or intracameral chemotherapy delivery with intravenous or intra-arterial chemotherapy.

# 4. Ocular Salvage of One Eye

Among Rb patients undergoing ocular salvage of one eye requiring chemoreduction, we recommend intravenous or intra-arterial chemotherapy delivery.

# 5. Simultaneous Ocular Salvage of Bilateral Eye Disease

Among Rb patients undergoing simultaneous ocular salvage of bilateral eye disease requiring chemoreduction, we recommend intravenous systemic chemotherapy delivery.

# 6. External Beam Radiation Therapy and Enucleation

Question 6: Among patients with intraocular retinoblastoma not responding to ocular salvage treatment of chemotherapy with local therapy, what are the indications of external beam radiation therapy and enucleation?

Among patients with intraocular Rb not responding to or with failure of ocular salvage treatments, we recommend enucleation or salvage external beam radiation therapy.

# 7. Preference for Enucleation

Among patients with intraocular Rb not responding to or with failure of ocular salvage treatments, we recommend preference for enucleation over salvage external beam radiation therapy for patients less than one year old due to the increased risk of radiation induced secondary malignancy.

# 8. High Risk for Treatment Abandonment

Among patients with intraocular Rb not responding to ocular salvage treatments, we recommend enucleation when at high risk for treatment abandonment.
---
Among patients with intraocular Rb not responding to ocular salvage treatment of chemotherapy with local therapy, trial of salvage EBRT is a reasonable option when it involves the last remaining eye.

# Ungraded good practice statement

# Question 7: Among newly diagnosed IRSS stage 1 children with high-risk pathologic features, what is the recommended chemotherapy regimen?

Among newly diagnosed IRSS stage 1 children with high-risk pathologic features, we recommend referral for pathologic review of every enucleated eye by an experienced pathologist or ophthalmic pathologist.

# Ungraded good practice statement

Among newly diagnosed IRSS stage 1 children with high-risk pathologic features, we recommend that the Rb specialist and pediatric oncologist screen for extraocular disease or metastasis.

Among newly diagnosed IRSS stage 1 children with high-risk pathologic features, we recommend treatment with prophylactic chemotherapy.

Among newly diagnosed IRSS stage 1 children with high-risk pathologic features in settings 1, 2 and 3, we recommend adjuvant chemotherapy with Carboplatin + Etoposide + Vincristine regimen.

Among newly diagnosed IRSS stage 1 children with high-risk pathologic features in settings 1, 2 and 3 when there is Carboplatin shortage, we recommend giving Cyclophosphamide + Vincristine ± Doxorubicin.

# Question 8: Among newly diagnosed IRSS stage 2 children, what is the recommended chemotherapy regimen?

Among newly diagnosed IRSS stage 2 children, we recommend adjuvant systemic chemotherapy utilizing Vincristine + Etoposide + Carboplatin either alone or alternating with Cyclophosphamide and an anthracycline AND radiation of the orbital and optic nerve up to chiasm.
---
# Question 9: Among newly diagnosed IRSS stage 3 (or orbital) retinoblastoma, what is the recommended treatment regimen?

Among IRSS stage 3 children in settings 1 and 2, we recommend neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy followed by enucleation, adjuvant systemic chemotherapy regimen utilizing Vincristine + Etoposide + Carboplatin either alone or alternating with Cyclophosphamide and an anthracycline and radiotherapy to orbits and optic nerve up to the chiasm.

Among IRSS stage 3 children in setting 3, we recommend neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy followed by enucleation, adjuvant systemic chemotherapy regimen utilizing Vincristine + Etoposide + Carboplatin either alone or alternating with Cyclophosphamide and an anthracycline OR Vincristine + Cisplatin + high-dose Cyclophosphamide and radiotherapy to orbits and optic nerve up to the chiasm.

Among IRSS stage 3 children, we do not recommend primary exenteration of the orbit for Rb.

# Question 10: Among newly diagnosed IRSS stage 4 (or metastatic) retinoblastoma, what is the recommended treatment regimen?

Among newly diagnosed IRSS stage 4 children, we recommend palliative care and/or low dose chemotherapy or oral metronomic chemotherapy.

Among newly diagnosed IRSS stage 4 children with Rb metastasis in bone marrow, bone or other organs or tissue in setting 3, we recommend enucleation of the eye, radiation, chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant if there is a chemotherapy response.

Among newly diagnosed IRSS stage 4 children with Rb tumor involving the meninges of the brain and spinal cord in setting 3, we recommend palliative treatment.

# 1. Introduction

Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in children, accounting for 3% to 5% of childhood malignancies. Most cases are diagnosed in children under five years old, with a median age diagnosis of two years. Retinoblastoma can be classified as familial or sporadic, bilateral or unilateral, and heritable or nonheritable. The hereditary form is associated with the loss of function of the RB1 gene due to an inherited or new germline mutation. All bilateral and familial forms are heritable. About two-thirds of all cases are unilateral, of which only 15% are heritable.2

The epidemiology of Retinoblastoma varies among countries in terms of incidence, stage at diagnosis, and survival. The incidence rate of Retinoblastoma in the United States and Europe is between two to five per million children aged 0-14 years, with survival rates of over 90% as cases are detected early.2 Low to middle-income countries (LMIC) report higher incidence rates and challenges with delayed diagnosis and advanced stages, resulting in low survival.3,4 The advanced stage at diagnosis is seen in up to 42.9% of patients from low-income countries, 19.7% from lower-middle-income countries, 5.4% from upper-middle-income countries, and 0.8% from high-income countries.3 Three-year survival rates also differ among regions at 99.5% in high-income countries, 91.2% in upper-middle-income countries, 80.3% in lower-middle-income countries, and 57.3% in low-income countries.3

In the Philippines, the Rizal and Manila regional population-based cancer registries reported a high incidence rate of 6.9 per million children 0-14 years.5 This information shows that an estimated 230 new cases are expected each year. However, a survey done from 2014-2016 of 16 centers nationwide reported only seeing a total of 83 new patients per annum, pointing to an issue of underdiagnosis.6 Local data from the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) of 95 patients from 2014-2016 showed that 48% were Stage 3 and 4 diseases at diagnosis.6 The 3-year overall survival rate was only 43%, and abandonment of treatment occurred at 11%.6 Moreover, a 10-year multicenter retrospective study among retinoblastoma patients from eleven institutions in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao revealed that annually, a median of 58 ± 10 new cases were seen, with 71% having unilateral disease.7 The median delay in consultation is nine months, the longest in patients with unilateral disease and those from the Visayas region. In addition, 47% of patients presented at diagnosis already had extraocular disease.7

The diagnosis and treatment of Retinoblastoma requires hospitals to have a multidisciplinary team, including a pediatric ophthalmologist, radiation oncologist, and pediatric oncologist, as well as specialized equipment.8 At the health system level, a robust Retinoblastoma referral pathway is essential where complex cases are sent promptly to advanced centers with a well-equipped and experienced multidisciplinary care team. These pose a significant healthcare investment for a rare disease, especially in low- and middle-income countries. In the Philippines, surveys among eye and cancer centers on Retinoblastoma service delivery highlighted the problems of lack of treatment standards and access to multidisciplinary care.6,9,10 Currently, there is no official assessment of the
---
capacity and resources of local Eye and Cancer Centers to provide comprehensive retinoblastoma care. The country also does not have a defined retinoblastoma referral pathway. However, the classification of Cancer and Eye Centers according to general oncologic and ophthalmic service capacity (basic comprehensive care, advanced comprehensive care, and national specialty centers) has started. The basis of this resource-stratified framework classification considered base facility (infrastructure), resource level (i.e., service capabilities), catchment population, diagnostic, medical and surgical services, fixed medical assets, surgical infrastructure and equipment, human resource assets, training, research, and other services.11

The National Integrated Cancer Control Act (NICCA) mandates the creation of Cancer Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) for adult and pediatric populations. Well-implemented CPGs ensure appropriate, effective, and cost-efficient treatments are provided. Countries with national retinoblastoma CPGs, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, have streamlined patients' diagnosis, referral, and multidisciplinary treatment. Retinoblastoma survival rates in these countries are over 95%.12 For low- and middle-income countries, the Pediatric Oncology in Developing Countries (PODC) committee of the International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) proposed retinoblastoma treatment guidelines contextualized according to the hospitals and the country's capacity to deliver care. Setting 1 applies to centers and countries with the fewest resources and minimal technology (e.g., low-dose chemotherapy, imaging, ophthalmologic and pathologic services). Setting 2 is for essential resources and Setting 3 is for centers and countries with modern resources and technologies.13

In their Administrative Order 2018-0019, the DOH provides the framework for quality CPG development.1 Currently, only three pediatric cancers have local CPGs: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Burkitt's lymphoma, and Wilms tumor. Although a common retinoblastoma protocol, RB Metro Manila, has been used by PGH, East Avenue Medical Center, and Philippine Children's Medical Center since 2013, a national evidence-based CPG is needed to improve poor treatment outcomes.14

# 2. Objective, Scope, Target population and Target users

The Philippine Retinoblastoma Clinical Practice Guideline is composed of 10 key questions with 30 graded recommendations and three ungraded good practice statements that are directed towards the screening, diagnosis, referral and treatment of children with retinoblastoma to improve the overall clinical outcomes and survival of patients following a resource stratification. Through this guideline, the Rb GDG aims to provide locally applicable and standardized practice guidance for pediatric patients with Rb across healthcare setting.

This is intended to be used by clinicians in the primary healthcare setting and specialists in cancer centers. It may also serve as a basis for the DOH-approved standards of care and the development of the PhilHealth benefit package for retinoblastoma.

# 3. CPG Development Methodology

The guideline development process followed the framework developed by DOH, consisting of the following phases: Preparation, Evidence Generation, Appraisal, and Implementation. See Figures 1 and 2. It followed the ADAPTE process of CPG development.15

# A. Creation of Working Groups

The Steering Committee (SC) was composed of specialists, methodologists, non-medical doctors, and policymakers: Ana Patricia Alcasabas, M.D. (Pediatric Oncologist), Gary John Mercado, M.D. (Ophthalmologist Ocular Oncologist), Nonette Cupino, M.D. (Radiation Oncologist), Clarito Cairo Jr. M.D. (Department of Health), Cherie Grace G. Quingking, M.D. (Methodologist) and Mr. Teddy S. Dizon (Layperson).

A Technical Working Group (TWG) was created to review and grade the evidence. The TWG was composed of clinical epidemiologists, evidence-based medicine practitioners, and biostatisticians.

A Consensus Panel (CP) was formed composed of content experts from the government and private sectors including primary care providers, pediatric clinicians, public health practitioners, program implementers, patient representatives, and representatives from different medical societies such as Pediatric Oncology, Ophthalmology, Radiation Oncology, Genetics, Pathology, and Palliative Care.

All members of the steering committee, technical working group, and consensus panel accomplished a written conflict of interest (COI) declaration prior to their participation. COI declaration form was provided to document the disclosure of COIs. Also, an agreement to the publication of the CPG contributing to the formulation of recommendations is documented. The COIs were screened independently for recommendation of extent of participation or COI management. All disclosed COIs and corresponding action taken were reported and published in the annex of this document. Any serious COIs resulted in the member’s exclusion from the project.

# B. CPG Development

# Identification of key clinical issues

The Steering Committee convened to identify key clinical issues. A total of 10 key questions needing recommendations were prioritized and formulated based on the issues identified. The questions were constructed using the PICO Framework (population, intervention/exposure, comparison, and outcomes).

|PICO|Description|
|---|---|
|Population|Among pediatric age group at risk of, and newly diagnosed with Rb|
|Intervention|Screening, Diagnosis, Referral and Treatment|
|Comparator|Medical specialist and allied health professionals|
|Outcomes|Overall survival rate, disease-free survival, recurrence, and remission|

# Review and Grading of Evidence

Considering the time and resources to produce quality CPGs, it is recommended that existing guidelines be adapted to reduce duplication of effort and update existing guidelines in a shorter period of time. In this CPG development process, guideline adaptation by the ADAPTE method was considered to address specific health questions generated. Independent methodologists and reviewers determined if adaptation of any existing CPG was feasible and consequently created the evidence base and recommendation matrix.

The evidence reviewers utilized the ADAPTE method to review existing guidelines for inclusion in the evidence base and drafting of recommendation matrix. The ADAPTE collaboration has developed a systematic approach to aid in the adaptation of guidelines. The systematic approach aids in the use and modification of existing guidelines to customize an existing guideline to suit the local context while addressing relevant health questions. A systematic search of existing guidelines in multiple databases, including search for existing Retinoblastoma clinical practice guidelines as well as published and unpublished studies based on PICO, MeSH and free text through electronic databases including MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and local databases. Latest versions of the guidelines were also searched to ensure currency of the recommendations. Assessment of the guidelines yielded from the systemic search were then given consideration for adaptation by assessment if it meets the qualities of a high-quality guideline using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument as well as if it can address the specific clinical questions. The AGREE II instrument provides a framework for assessing the quality of CPGs. The 23 items in the AGREE instrument assess the methods used for developing the guideline and quality of reporting. Assessment is focused on the rigor and overall score. The domains and criteria for the AGREE II tool are shown in Annex N. The guidelines were assessed for guideline quality, currency, content, consistency, and applicability. The characteristics and contents of the source guidelines are summarized in Annex C.

The ERE drafted the initial recommendation statements to include level of evidence based on the source guidelines and its references. All guidelines included utilized by recommended Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) for evaluation of level of evidence. See Table 2.

# Table 2. Quality of evidence using the GRADE Framework

|Quality of Evidence|Study Design|
|---|---|
|High|Further research is very unlikely to Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)|
|Lower if:|Study quality: Poor quality of implementation|
|Higher if:|Stronger association: Large|
---
# Change of RCT

# Magnitude of confidence in the estimate of effect

|Moderate|Further research is likely to have an impact on the confidence in the estimate of effect|Inconsistency of results|Downgraded|
|---|---|---|---|
|Low|Further research is very likely to have an important impact on the confidence in the estimate of effect|Indirectness: Different population, intervention, outcomes|Very large magnitude of effect, no major threats to validity|
|Very Low|Any estimate of effect is very uncertain|Case series or expert opinion| |

The GRADE approach was also used to evaluate evidence on the diagnosis of retinoblastoma as shown in the tables below. See Tables 3 and 4.

# Table 3. Factors that decrease the quality of evidence for studies of diagnostic accuracy and how they differ from evidence for other interventions

|Factors that determine the quality of evidence|Study design|Explanation of how the factor may differ from the quality of evidence for other interventions|
|---|---|---|
|Different criteria for accuracy studies| | |
|Risk of bias (limitations in study design and execution)| |Cross-sectional or cohort studies in patients with diagnostic uncertainty and direct comparison of test results with an appropriate reference standard (best possible alternative test strategy) are considered high quality and can move to moderate, low or very low depending on other factors.|
|Different criteria for accuracy studies| |• Representativeness of the population that was intended to be sampled • Independent comparison with the best alternative test strategy • All enrolled patients should receive the new test and the best alternative test strategy|
---
# Diagnostic Uncertainty

- Diagnostic uncertainty should be given
- Is the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition?

# Indirectness

Patient population, diagnostic test, comparison test and indirect comparisons of tests

The quality of evidence can be lowered if there are significant differences between the populations studied and those for whom the recommendation is intended (in prior testing, the spectrum of disease or co-morbidity); if there are important differences in the tests studied and the diagnostic expertise of those applying them in the studies compared to the settings for which the recommendations are intended; or if the tests being compared are each compared to a reference (gold) standard in different studies and not directly compared in the same studies.

# Important Inconsistency in Study Results

# Imprecise Evidence

Panels assessing diagnostic tests often face an absence of direct evidence about impact on patient-important outcomes. They must make deductions from diagnostic test studies about the balance between the presumed influences on patient-important outcomes of any differences in true and false positives and true and false negatives in relationship to test complications and costs. Therefore, accuracy studies typically provide low quality evidence for making recommendations due to indirectness of the outcomes, similar to surrogate outcomes for treatments.

# For Accuracy Studies

- Unexplained inconsistency in sensitivity, specificity or likelihood ratios (rather than relative risks or mean differences) can lower the quality of evidence.
- Wide confidence intervals for estimates of test accuracy, or true and false positive, and negative rates can lower the quality of evidence.
---
# High probability of Publication bias

# Upgrading for dose effect, large effects residual plausible bias and confounding

# Similar criteria

A high risk of publication bias (e.g., evidence only from small studies supporting a new test, or asymmetry in a funnel plot) can lower the quality of evidence.

# Similar criteria

For all these factors, methods have not been properly developed. However, determining a dose effect (e.g., increasing levels of anticoagulation measured by INR increase the likelihood for vitamin K deficiency or vitamin K antagonists). A very large likelihood of disease (not of patient-important outcomes) associated with test results may increase the quality evidence. However, there is some disagreement if and how dose effects play a role in assessing the quality of evidence in DTA studies.

---
# Risk of bias

Could the (high, low, or unclear) selection of patients have introduced bias?

Could the conduct or interpretation of the index test have introduced bias?

Could the reference standard, its conduct, or its interpretation have introduced bias?

Could the patient flow have introduced bias?

# Formulation of Recommendations

The summary of the findings and preliminary recommendations was created by the TWG and sent to the Steering Committee as well as the Consensus Panel for review. A face-to-face meeting was held with all the group members present to discuss the recommendations and issues or concerns arising. Panelists voted on the direction of recommendations (i.e., for or against) based on their evaluation of the potential positive and negative effects of an intervention or test on outcomes deemed "critical." A strong recommendation was made when the panel was confident that the benefits of the intervention or test outweighed any drawbacks, or vice versa. A weak recommendation was issued when the panel had uncertainties about the trade-offs, due to factors such as insufficient high-quality evidence, unclear estimates of benefit or harm, limited applicability to specific populations or settings, or when the expected benefits came with significant costs.

Factors influencing the strength of recommendations include the balance between benefits and harms, costs, feasibility and acceptability, values and preferences, baseline risks, and resource implications. See Table 5. The moderator facilitated the session using the nominal group technique for consensus building.

On applicability of the recommendations, the recommendation matrix developed was for finalization of the CP who were provided by the evidence reviewers with a guide on determining the strengths of recommendation. Recommendations may either be strong or weak. Strong recommendations refer to issues where the guideline development group may be confident that the benefits outweigh the risks or costs of an intervention, or vice versa, whereas weak recommendations are those where there is appreciable uncertainty on the calculus of benefits and risks. A summary of the implication of recommendation strength on each type of guideline user which is reproduced in full in Table 5.
---
# Table 5. Implications of strength of recommendations to patients, clinicians and policy makers using the GRADE approach

|Strength of Recommendation|Implications of the recommendations|
|---|---|
|Strong|Patients|
|Most people in the situation would want the recommended course of action and only very few would not; request for discussion if the intervention is not offered| |
|Clinicians| |
|Most patients should receive the recommended course of action. The recommendation can be used as a quality performance indicator| |
|Policy Makers| |
|The recommendation can be adopted as a policy in most situations| |
|Weak|Patients|
|Most people in the situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not| |
|Clinicians| |
|Different choices are appropriate for different patients, and clinicians must help patients arrive at a management decision consistent with the patients’ values and preferences| |
|Policy Makers| |
|Policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders| |

Benefits may not warrant the cost or resource requirements in all settings
---
The recommendations presented were voted upon by the consensus panel and a minimum of 75% agreement was needed to reach consensus. A maximum of 3 rounds of voting was held until consensus was reached. Recommendations were stated as either strong or weak.

Due to resource and schedule difficulties encountered to convene the CP, the recommendations that did not reach 75% agreement after 3 rounds of voting, eDelphi technique was done. Two rounds of eDelphi was done to reach final consensus for the remaining recommendations.

The eDelphi using Google survey was facilitated by the research assistant. eDelphi gathered the voting of the CP was done as follows: A – accept completely, B – accept with some reservations, C – accept with major reservations, D – reject with some reservations, E – reject completely. After two rounds of eDelphi, all recommendation statements reached consensus of more than 75% voted A or B. Finally, the contextualization of recommendation statements is included based on the values, preferences and lived experiences shared by the CP.

# Formulation of Good Practice Statement

The formulation of the good practice statements reflects the values, perspectives and preferences of both SC and CP. The ungraded good practice statements were carefully discussed and deemed to be necessary with high level of certainty that the overall benefits outweigh harms. The checklist for what makes a good practice statement is summarized in Table 6.

|Table 6. Checklist for Good Practice Statement|Table 6. Checklist for Good Practice Statement|
|---|
|A question applicable to any recommendation (but often violated in good practice statements):|(i) Is the statement clear and actionable?|
|Question particular to good practice statement:| |
| |(ii) Is the message necessary regarding actual health care practice?|
| |(iii) After consideration of all relevant outcomes and potential downstream consequences, will implementing the good practice statement result in large net positive consequences?|
| |(iv) Is collecting and summarizing the evidence a poor use of guideline panel’s limited time and energy (opportunity cost is large)?|
| |(v) Is there a well-documented clear and explicit rationale connecting the indirect evidence?|

The answer to all questions (ii) to (v) should be yes to proceed with a good practice statement.

# Review and Writing of the Final CPG Document

The final recommendations, and consensus issues, will be turned over to the scientific writer for the development of the final manuscript using the format from the 2002 Conference on Guideline Standardization (COGS).21 In the next publications, there be three different versions will be prepared according to the target user: a detailed full text, a quick reference guide, and a layman’s version for the public.

In the development this CPG, the funders, Philippine Academy of Ophthalmologists, Philippine Society of Pediatric Oncology, University of the Philippines – Philippine General Hospital Expanded Research Office and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital have neither imposed nor exerted influenced on the generating PICO questions, evidence gathering and synthesis, development and finalization of recommendations, and finalization of this CPG document.

# Self-evaluation of the Final CPG Document

Three non-medical individuals, 1 male and 2 females, independently evaluated the CPG document using the AGREE II Reporting Tool.

# External Review of CPG Document

The guideline developer solicited feedback from policymakers, general practitioners and specialists from August 8 to 22, 2024 using AGREE II Reporting Tool. The feedback was deliberated by the SC and incorporated in the finalization of this document. The external evaluation covered six domains: (1) scope and purpose, (2) stakeholder involvement, (3) rigor of development, (4) clarity of presentation, (5) applicability, and (6) editorial independence. Additionally, the overall guideline assessment was included as part of the evaluation conducted by all six CPG external evaluators (see Appendix O).

# Submission to the DOH for Appraisal

The final draft will be subjected to the approval of the National Guideline Review Panel of the Department of Health.

The approved CPG the steps for information dissemination, impact assessment, and updating of recommendations will be done. The need to update the CPG will be determined annually by the members of the Steering Committee based on review of current literature. If an update is necessary, the CPG Task Force will be reconvened.

# 4. Recommendation and Evidence Summaries

# 4.1 Among children with a family history of Retinoblastoma, will serial dilated fundus examination be acceptable towards early detection when genetic testing is not available?

# Recommendation

Among children with a family history of Rb, we recommend serial dilated fundus examination. (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence)

# Consensus Issues

Ideally, all retinoblastoma patients should undergo genetic testing for genomic RB1 mutation. Those positive for a mutation have familial retinoblastoma and their relatives (children) are at risk for getting the disease. Likewise, these children may also develop a second retinoblastoma in the other eye.

Currently, genetic testing for RB1 mutation is not available in the Philippines and the resources required to send the specimen overseas are an out-of-pocket expense.

In Settings 1 and 2, clinical screening for the early detection of retinoblastoma should be prioritized for at-risk children, particularly in lower-middle-income countries like the Philippines, where genetic testing may not be readily available. According to the World Bank, lower-middle-income countries are defined as those with a gross national income (GNI) per capita between $1,146 and $4,515. Clinical screening is especially recommended for two groups of children: (1) those with a family history of retinoblastoma, and (2) those who have recently been diagnosed and treated for the condition.

# Review Methods

Without publication date filter, a systematic search was done from September 2022 to June 2023, using international (i.e., Medline, Central, and Google Scholar) and local databases (i.e., HERDIN). Unpublished studies were requested through the Steering Committee. Keywords used were a combination of MeSH and free text search with the terms ((“at risk children” OR “with family history”) AND “Retinoblastoma” AND “screening”). No additional filter was applied for comprehensive search.

No relevant randomized controlled trials were found during the search. Two clinical practice guidelines were included after appraisal using AGREE II Tool for ADAPTE.
---
# Evidence Summary and Source of Guideline Recommendations

Children “at risk” was defined as a person with family history of retinoblastoma in a parent, sibling, or first- or second-degree relative. Ideally, it is recommended that risk stratification with genetic counseling and testing serve as the basis for screening and present a risk-stratified schedule for ophthalmic screening examinations for countries with available resources. Systematic screening of children at elevated risk because of family history of retinoblastoma has two purposes: (1) to provide a method for detecting disease at the earliest possible stage and (2) to focus care on the children at highest risk, while decreasing unnecessary evaluations for children at low or no risk above that of the general population.

# Table 7. Screening Recommendations Among at Risk Pediatric Patients

|Summary of Guideline Recommendations|Method|Certainty of Evidence|Guideline Code|
|---|---|---|---|
|All children at elevated risk for retinoblastoma above the population risk require serial dilated fundus examination by an ophthalmologist with experience in retinoblastoma. Depending on the clinical setting and resources, this may be an ocular oncologist, pediatric ophthalmologist, retina specialist, or comprehensive ophthalmologist.|ADAPTE|Low|AAO (2017)|

available resources and expert clinician preference.

We recommend that following completion of treatment, EUAs for children at risk of developing new Rb tumors continue as often as every 3 weeks, or at longer intervals as tumor activity decreases, until risk of new tumors and recurrences are low, and the child is able to cooperate in clinic (at about 3 years of age).

The presented schedules are general guidelines and reflect a schedule for examination in which no lesions of concern are noted (see Figure 3). It may be appropriate to examine some children more frequently. Decision regarding examination methods, examination under anesthesia (EUA) versus non-sedated examination in the clinic are complex and best decided by the clinician in discussion with the patient’s family. The preference of most clinical centers involved in the creation of this consensus statement is reflected but individual centers may make policy decisions based on available resources and expert clinician preference. Examination under anesthesia is strongly recommended for any child who is unable to participate in a clinic examination sufficiently to allow thorough examination of the retina. Clinical centers may prefer EUA for high- and intermediate-risk children (calculated risk >1% from birth to 8 weeks of age).

# 4.2 Among children with suspicion of Retinoblastoma, what is the recommended work-up to accurately diagnose Retinoblastoma?

# Recommendations

1. Among children with suspicion of Rb, we recommend to clinically diagnose based on comprehensive history, physical examination, and indirect ophthalmoscopy done by a capable ophthalmologist. (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence)
2. Among children with suspicion of Rb, we recommend multidisciplinary discussions and imaging using B scan ocular ultrasound, cranial and orbital MRI with contrast or cranial and orbital CT scan. (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence)

# Consensus Issues

The diagnosis of Retinoblastoma is mainly clinical through a detailed history and comprehensive ophthalmic examination.

Accuracy, availability, accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and safety were implied when selecting additional diagnostic tests for pediatric patients suspected with Retinoblastoma. The tests may include B scan ocular ultrasound, contrast enhanced MRI or CT scan, and its use will depend on the suspected degree of the disease and the test’s availability. After the ophthalmologist has examined and made an initial assessment, a clear rationale as to why these diagnostic tests need to be used should be established.

The current reference guidelines reiterated that, if the facility does not have minimum equipment, and cannot diagnose and treat, the attending medical doctor must refer the patient to capable centers.

# Review Methods

Without publication date filter, a systematic search was done from September 2022 to June 2023, using international (i.e., Medline, Central, and Google Scholar) and local databases (i.e., HERDIN). Unpublished studies were requested through the Steering Committee. Keywords used were a combination of MeSH and free text search with the terms “Retinoblastoma” AND “diagnostics”. No additional filter was applied for comprehensive search.

No relevant randomized controlled trials were found during the search. One clinical practice guideline and one study were included after appraisal using AGREE II Tool for ADAPTE.

# Evidence Summary and Source of Guideline Recommendations

Early detection and immediate referral of children with retinoblastoma (Rb) increases the possibility of saving lives and preserving useful vision. Diagnosis of retinoblastoma is mainly clinical and focused on the findings of a dilated fundus examination utilizing indirect ophthalmoscopy. Diagnosis of retinoblastoma includes clinical evaluation, physical examination and diagnostics which are useful for staging of retinoblastoma (see Table 8). B scan ultrasound, contrast enhanced cranio-orbital MRI or CT scan are other ancillary diagnostic tests used for confirmation and staging of retinoblastoma. These are discussed further in Clinical Question 3.

# Table 8. Clinical evaluation and physical examination

|Clinical Evaluation|Remarks|
|---|---|
|Visual Acuity|Age-appropriate visual acuity measurement should be recorded on initial ophthalmic evaluation.|
|External Eye Examination|Attention must focus on the presence of ophthalmological signs such as: leukocoria, strabismus, buphthalmos, proptosis, conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, iris heterochromia, rubeosis iridis, and increased intraocular pressure.|
|Dilated Fundus Examination|Detailed and extensive evaluation of the fundus should describe the appearance, size and location of the suspected lesions and associated vitreoretinal signs such as retinal detachment and vitreous seeds. Retinal evaluation should extend up to the ora serrata.|
|Physical Examination|Evaluation for enlarged ipsilateral preauricular and cervical lymph nodes must be performed. Also evaluate for signs of metastatic disease such as bone pain and neurological deficits.|

who is fully aware of the importance of leukocoria as a sign of Rb.

# Recommendations

We recommend that any child with strabismus or suspected strabismus be seen by the child’s pediatrician or family doctor.

We recommend that the red reflex test be applied to any child with strabismus or suspected strabismus.

We recommend urgent referral (within 72 hours) to an ophthalmologist of any child with strabismus or suspected strabismus and an abnormal red reflex.

We recommend that appointments with ophthalmology or tertiary Rb centers should be given within 72 hours for the above signs of abnormality, which constitutes an emergency.

All patients should undergo a complete ophthalmological examination under anesthesia, including tonometry and slit-lamp examination, by an experienced ophthalmologist using indirect ophthalmoscopy.

In programs where conservative therapy is undertaken with chemoreduction and localized therapy, a digital camera for documenting the fundoscopic findings may be helpful.

# 4.3 Among children diagnosed with Retinoblastoma, what is the recommended work-up to accurately stage Retinoblastoma?

# Recommendations

1. Among children diagnosed with Rb, we recommend multidisciplinary team discussions and appropriate imaging done in experienced centers. (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence)
2. Among children diagnosed with Rb, we recommend B scan ocular ultrasound and MRI or high-quality CT scan with contrast of the head and orbit for initial staging purposes. (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence)
3. Among children diagnosed with Rb, when MRI of the brain and orbit is available and accessible, we recommend its preference over CT scan of the brain and orbit with high quality contrast. (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence)
4. Among children diagnosed with Rb showing signs of extraocular disease, we suggest performing lumbar puncture and/or bone marrow examination for screening of metastasis. (Weak recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)

---
# International Retinoblastoma Staging System (IRSS)

A disease-staging system for children with retinoblastoma is essential for the initial evaluation of the extent of extraretinal dissemination and prediction of survival.

Classification and staging of disease severity require examination under anesthesia (EUA), imaging studies, and pathology review. The intraocular staging for retinoblastoma, the International Intraocular Retinoblastoma Classification (IIRC), is based on the extent and size of tumor involvement in the eye under EUA.

B scan ocular ultrasound is able to reveal the pathognomonic signs for diagnosis and determine the intraocular extent of retinoblastoma. It has limited accuracy in determining extraocular extension. Both plain and contrast enhanced MRI and CT scan of the orbit and brain demonstrate extent of spread of cancer within the eye, out of eye or into optic nerves, and any tumor in the suprasellar or pineal area (trilateral retinoblastoma). While CT is easy and quick in most centers and shows the pathognomonic calcification of Rb, it does incur radiation exposure that may increase the risk of second primary malignant tumors in individuals with germline RB1 mutation.

MRI is preferable for these cases, since it entails no radiation exposure. MRI is also more sensitive in delineating suspicious involvement of the optic nerves, and meningeal disease of the brain and spinal cord. These are summarized in Table 10.

# Table 10. Summary of Considerations for Imaging

|Imaging|Considerations|
|---|---|
|Ultrasound (B-Scan)|B scan ocular ultrasound is an inexpensive modality available in most eye treatment facilities. The procedure requires no sedation. It can detect the presence of intralesional calcification which is highly suggestive of retinoblastoma. These areas of calcification will manifest highly reflective echoes with acoustic shadowing. The intraocular extent of disease can be assessed with this modality, specifically the tumor location and size as well as associated features like retinal detachment and vitreous seeding. B scan ultrasound can measure globe enlargement (buphthalmos) and with limited accuracy detect areas of possible extrascleral extension. For retinoblastoma, high frequency B-scan ultrasonography (20–50MHz), also known as ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), has been shown to be essential for determining the proximity of the tumor to the anterior portion of eye.|
|MRI brain + orbit with contrast enhancement|Similar to ultrasound, MRI can delineate intraocular tumors, measure its size and detect for intralesional calcification. Calcifications will manifest as signal voids. Associated retinal detachments are likewise detected and the quality of the vitreous and subretinal fluid is assessed. MRI more accurately|
---
shows extraocular extension of the tumor as evidenced by the presence of extrascleral nodules, gross orbital tumor and widening of the optic nerve. Cranial MRI will detect for intracranial retinoblastoma extension and for pinealoblastoma or trilateral disease. MRI does not use ionizing radiation and therefore does not contribute to the risk of developing secondary malignant neoplasms. The test is motion sensitive hence sedation is necessary for most children. MRI is expensive and made even more because of the need for sedation.

# CT brain + orbit

CT scan can delineate intraocular tumors, measure its size and more definitely detect for intralesional calcification. Associated retinal detachments are likewise detected. CT scan may show extraocular extension of the tumor as evidenced by the presence of extrascleral nodules, gross orbital tumor and widening of the optic nerve but with less definition as compared to MRI. Similarly Cranial CT will detect for intracranial retinoblastoma extension and for pinealoblastoma or trilateral disease but with less details. CT scan utilizes ionizing radiation and may contribute to increasing the risk of developing secondary malignant neoplasms especially with repeated testing and in infants under 1 year of age. CT imaging is generally avoided in retinoblastoma, especially in patients with a germline RB1 mutation. This modality is quicker and less expensive than MRI, usually requires no sedation and is generally more available even in low resource areas.

Lumbar puncture and/or bone marrow examination should be considered when patients have either clinical, imaging or pathologic features of extraocular disease. On physical examination, these children may present with proptosis and ocular motility limitations. Evaluation of the CSF or bone marrow can distinguish between IRSS stage II or III (extra-ocular or orbital disease) and stage IV (metastatic dissemination). The centrifuged CSF, bone marrow aspirate and bone marrow biopsy should be reviewed by a pathologist.

When the staging workup is completed, treatment planning depends on the clinical scenario (unilateral vs. bilateral disease) and on the stage (intraocular, extraocular or metastatic) of disease. The risks and benefits of the proposed treatment plan are weighed, and the final decisions are made in a multidisciplinary team discussion that include the parents. The priority is to save the child’s life, second to save the eye(s), and finally, to optimize visual function for patients with either unilateral or bilateral Rb.

As for diagnostic accuracies of the three diagnostic modalities, two meta-analyses by de Graaf et. al. (2014) and Cho et. al. (2021) included studies that analyzed the accuracy of MRI versus histopathologic evaluation of enucleated eyes. Accuracy results are shown in Table 11. The use of ultrasound (B-scan) is also comparable with the use of MRI in the diagnosis of retinoblastoma with an accuracy of 94.9%. However,

A B-scan ultrasound cannot determine tumor extension into the orbit, lymph nodes, optic nerves and brain.

# 4.4 Among intraocular Retinoblastoma patients on active ocular salvage therapy, what is the optimal timing of examination under anesthesia (EUA) to evaluate treatment response and disease status?

# Recommendation

Among intraocular Rb patients on active ocular salvage therapy, we recommend EUA, evaluation of treatment response, and local consolidation therapy to be performed by an ophthalmologist on the scheduled day of chemotherapy delivery. (Strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)

# Consensus Issues

No noted consensus issues.

# Review Methods

A systematic search was done from September 2022 to June 2023, using international (Medline, Central, and Google Scholar) and local databases, (i.e., HERDIN). Unpublished studies were requested through the Steering Committee. Keywords used were a combination of MeSH and free text search with the terms “Retinoblastoma” AND “examination under anesthesia” OR “EUA”. No additional filter was applied for comprehensive search. No relevant randomized controlled trials were found during the search. One clinical practice guideline was included after appraisal using AGREE II Tool for ADAPTE.

# Evidence Summary and Source of Guideline Recommendations

There were no systematic reviews, meta-analyses, or randomized controlled trials that directly examined diagnostic effectiveness regarding optimal timing of examinations under anesthesia (EUA) to evaluate immediate treatment response and disease status. The certainty of evidence is very low due to very serious issues of imprecision, risk of bias, and indirectness, as the best available evidence does not directly answer the question.

Current practice involves conducting patient follow-ups by an ophthalmologist, which is consistent with other studies following the Associacion de Hemato-Oncologia Pediatrica de Centro America (AHOPCA) Retinoblastoma Protocol, and Canadian Retinoblastoma Society (2009). The outline of the follow up procedures can be seen in Figure 4.
---
# Figure 4. Schedule of EUA and clinic visits for children with Retinoblastoma

Immediately upon diagnosis, the child undergoes EUA immediately and every 3 to 4 weeks thereafter, depending on the extent of tumor activity and the ocular salvage therapy plan. Chemo-assisted therapies like chemothermotherapy and chemocryotherapy involves the tandem treatment of systemic or intra-arterial chemotherapy with local therapies of laser and cryotherapy. Thermotherapy has synergistic effect with carboplatin-based chemotherapy. The current Vincristine + Eptoposide + Carboplatin (VEC) regimen is given in a 21–28-day cycle and should be done in conjunction with local laser and cryotherapy. The VEC regimen for ocular salvage with local therapy is performed for a minimum of 6 cycles but extendable depending on tumor response and systemic chemotherapy limitations. Continued pure local therapies can be continued for persistent active tumors.

When Rb tumors remain inactive after treatment for a significant period of time, and the risk is low for new tumors and/or recurrences, the active follow-up for surveillance of new tumors can transition to the clinic, as long as the child can cooperate (at approximately 3 years of age), with examination every 6 months. After age 9, long-term follow-up begins, with annual clinic visits. After age 15, clinic visits may occur every 2–3 years, for the lifetime of the patient.

The Canadian Retinoblastoma Society recommends active follow up until age 9 years, or 5 years after the last active treatment is performed and Long-term follow-up for Rb covers the period of follow-up after 9 years of age or beyond 5 years after the last active treatment. This was based on three observation studies. The certainty of evidence is very low due to very serious issues on imprecision, risk of bias, and indirectness, as the best available evidence does not directly answer the question. The three other recommendations cited by Canadian Retinoblastoma Society were based on expert opinion and consensus.

An additional consideration is offering a timely molecular diagnosis of RB1 mutations. The intervention enables earlier detection and treatment for patients at risk with retinoblastoma; empowers families to make informed family-planning decisions; and costs less than conventional surveillance. One genetic study shows that the costs from

Repeated clinical examinations of children in these families substantially exceeds the cost of molecular testing, which can be carried over in succeeding generations.31

# 4.5 Among newly diagnosed children with intraocular Retinoblastoma, what are the indications for upfront enucleation and ocular salvage therapy?

# Recommendations

# Upfront Enucleation

1. Among newly diagnosed children with intraocular Rb, we recommend that upfront enucleation be performed for IIRC Group E. (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence)
2. Among newly diagnosed children with intraocular Rb, we recommend that upfront enucleation be performed for IIRC Group D when the other eye is normal or Group A. (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence)
3. Among newly diagnosed children with intraocular Rb with no access to globe sparing modality or are at risk of poor follow up, we recommend that primary enucleation can be relatively indicated. Primary enucleation is an option especially but not limited to unilateral Rb cases. (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence)

# Ocular Salvage Therapy

1. Among newly diagnosed children with intraocular Rb, we recommend ocular salvage therapy for ICRB Groups A, B, and C. (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence)
2. Among newly diagnosed children with intraocular Rb, we recommend ocular salvage therapy for ICRB Group D eyes when it is the better of two eyes. (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence)
3. Among newly diagnosed children with intraocular Rb, we recommend against ocular salvage therapy when there is lack of access and availability to globe sparing modalities (chemotherapy and local therapy) or risk of poor follow-up. (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence)
4. Among Rb patients undergoing ocular salvage therapy with recalcitrant or residual vitreous or anterior chamber Rb seeds, we recommend intravitreal or intracameral chemotherapy delivery with intravenous or intra-arterial chemotherapy. (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence)
---
# 8.

Among Rb patients undergoing ocular salvage of one eye disease requiring chemoreduction, we recommend intravenous or intra-arterial chemotherapy delivery. (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence)

# 9.

Among Rb patients undergoing simultaneous ocular salvage of bilateral eye disease requiring chemoreduction, we recommend intravenous systemic chemotherapy delivery. (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence)

# Consensus Issues

Indications of upfront enucleation (eye surgery) or ocular salvage (attempt to save the eye) vary. Once these indications are present, that is when you are obliged to do the appropriate surgery. Ocular salvage refers to all possible ocular salvage procedures.

Enucleation would cure a high proportion of children with retinoblastoma. It is therefore important that ocular salvage treatments are not offered to patients with intraocular disease in a setting without facilities or experience in such procedures. Conservative therapy is usually not a priority in Setting 1, where most children die of extraocular retinoblastoma. When there is lack of access to globe sparing modalities, resource limitations or risk of poor follow-up, the guideline recommends primary enucleation as the relatively indicated treatment.

# Review Methods

A systematic search was done from September 2022 to June 2023, using international (i.e., Medline, Central, and Google Scholar) and local databases (i.e., HERDIN). Unpublished studies were requested through the Steering Committee. Keywords used were a combination of MeSH and free text search with the terms “Retinoblastoma” AND “enucleation” AND “ocular salvage”. No additional filter was applied for comprehensive search.

No relevant randomized controlled trials were found during the search. Two clinical practice guidelines were included after appraisal using AGREE II Tool for ADAPTE.

# Evidence Summary and Source of Guideline Recommendations

Enucleation removes the affected eye and a portion of the optic nerve and can be either a primary or secondary treatment for retinoblastoma. Primary enucleation is used to treat unilateral intraocular retinoblastoma whereas secondary enucleation is indicated when conservative treatment has failed or in the presence of phthisical (e.g., wasting, shrinking, nonfunctioning) eyes after high-dose chemotherapy. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the indications and the implications of enucleation both from a psychosocial perspective and with respect to the impact of
---
Monocular vision after unilateral enucleation. However, it is equally important to consider the negative impact of globe salvage on a child’s development. Patients undergoing enucleation have 1/3 fewer examinations under anesthesia (EUAs) compared to those managed conservatively and this is particularly relevant given the potential toxicity of anesthesia to the developing brain.35,36

In developed countries, less than 1% of children present with buphthalmos and fewer than 20% present with significant risk factors upon pathology examination.37,38 In more than 95% of cases, enucleation results in complete tumor removal with less than 5% having microscopically residual disease after enucleation. Hence, upfront enucleation is the treatment of choice for children with intraocular unilateral retinoblastoma.13 Even in developing countries, enucleation is considered as an excellent way to cure the disease when Rb is confined within the eye.36,39-40

The Canadian Retinoblastoma Society recommends unilateral enucleation to be the safest treatment in unifocal Rb with IIRC Group D and E eyes.8 Upfront removal of both eyes (bilateral primary enucleation) may be recommended to avoid the risk of systemic metastasis if both eyes present with Group E disease with an extremely poor visual potential. Furthermore, the guideline states that it may also not be in the best interest of the child to be exposed to chemotherapy or radiation-related morbidities with little possibility of a good outcome. A delay in enucleation may put the child at risk for extra-ocular Rb and life-threatening metastatic disease.41,42

The Canadian Retinoblastoma Society also considered performing enucleation for the following conditions: (1) recurrent tumors when all other treatment modalities have failed, (2) for complications such as total retinal detachment, complete media (vitreous) opacity and total hyphema (blood filling the eye) that prevent evaluation and treatment of potentially progressive tumor.8

In countries with setting 1, many patients present with enlarged eyeballs or buphthalmia.43,44 Severely buphthalmic eyes may be difficult to enucleate upfront. This scenario is especially important to avoid in settings with no radiotherapy since this will be needed to prevent tumor recurrence in the seeded areas. The SIOP-PODC recommends pre-enucleation chemotherapy to reduce tumor volume in severely buphthalmic eyes, thereby reducing the risk of eye rupture and tumor residue at the optic nerve margin.45,46 There is an increased risk of accidental rupture of the globe, leading to seeding of tumor cells around the surgical site which would necessitate intensive chemotherapy and orbital radiotherapy.

# Evidence Summary and Source of Guideline Recommendations

For many years external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) was the treatment of choice for Rb. In bilateral disease, the more advanced eye was usually enucleated, and the better eye was conserved with EBRT. Worldwide, radiotherapy is now rarely given as primary treatment for Rb as excellent results are achievable with chemotherapy/focal combination therapy.36,48

Patients with Rb previously treated with EBRT have an increased risk (up to 50%) of developing secondary non-Rb malignancies.35,48-51 Greater knowledge of these side effects such as facial deformities, cataracts, and dry eyes as well as the attendant risk of subsequent tumor development such as sarcoma, after EBRT, encouraged the switch to primary systemic chemotherapy plus focal therapy for the past decades.35,52 These risks are especially high for those treated with EBRT prior to 1 year of age, but secondary non-Rb malignancies may occur after radiation given at any age.37

National Retinoblastoma Strategy Canadian Guidelines for Care recommends EBRT when chemotherapy/focal therapy has failed to control the tumors, and it remains a very useful treatment for Rb.8 Furthermore, it recommends that orbital EBRT may supplement chemotherapy for orbital tumor recurrence or residual following enucleation. Brachytherapy is an excellent treatment for small, isolated tumors situated well away from the optic nerve or macula, and/or when tumor recurs focally following chemotherapy or EBRT.

To reduce risk of inducing secondary non-Rb malignancies or cosmetic deformities, stereotactic or intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) radiation techniques can result in delivery of a lower radiation dose to normal tissues surrounding the target area.53-55 Enucleation of the remaining eye may still be required to save the child’s life despite the use of radiotherapy after failed chemotherapy and focal therapy.

In developing countries, EBRT offers the benefit of less intensive follow-up and are likely to be cured with one 6-week course of radiotherapy, whereas children treated with chemo reduction, and local therapy usually need a more intensive, longer follow-up to consolidate tumor response and treat later relapses.13 Therefore, the availability of a high-quality EBRT facility is a priority in this scenario, especially in setting 2. For settings that continue to use EBRT, surgery for removal of radiation-induced cataracts that occur in almost all patients within a few years of irradiation should be available.

# Management of Retinoblastoma

# Consensus Issues

The availability of services in developing countries guides the choice of treatment, so it is essential to identify the local facilities in which to either establish a new retinoblastoma program or optimize an existing one. Settings were categorized based on resource availability as Setting 1, 2 and 3. (See Appendix F.)

The applicability of the recommended setting-based treatment recommendations for the management of retinoblastoma is important as our situation in the Philippines has all three.

# Review Methods

Without publication date filter, a systematic search was done from September 2022 to June 2023, using international (Medline, Central, and Google Scholar) and local database, HERDIN). Unpublished studies were requested through the Steering Committee. Keywords used were a combination of MeSH and free text search with the terms were “Retinoblastoma” AND “Treatment”.

No relevant randomized controlled trials were found during the search. One clinical practice guideline was included after appraisal using AGREE II Tool for ADAPTE.

# Background

The International Retinoblastoma Staging System (IRSS), a classification system for extraocular disease, describes Stage I as patients who had eye enucleation, with tumor completely resected histologically. Although enucleation has a cure rate of more than 90%, histopathologic investigation is essential to identify patients at high risk for recurrence. The high-risk histopathologic features (HRFs) are as follows: post laminar optic nerve invasion, massive posterior uveal invasion (≥ 3mm), concomitant focal choroid (<3mm) and optic nerve involvement (laminar and prelaminar), anterior chamber seeding, ciliary body infiltration, and iris infiltration. A systematic assessment of the HRFs was developed by the College of American Pathologists in order to facilitate synoptic reporting of pathologic findings.

A retrospective study in 2002 by Honavar et. al proved the effectiveness of receiving adjuvant chemotherapy to prevent metastasis post enucleation in patients with HRFs. Their protocol reviewed 80 retinoblastoma patients with HRFs post enucleation, and they reported a statistically significant difference (P=0.02) in the incidence of metastasis between patients given adjuvant chemotherapy at 4% (2/46) while 24% for those who had not (8/24). Two chemotherapy regimens were used in the study: vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide in 21 patients, and vincristine, etoposide, and carboplatin in 25 patients. Although there were two regimens used, the benefits of one over the other cannot be compared due to the limited number of metastases recorded.

Moreover, a retrospective case series done in 2011 by Kaliki et. al demonstrated the effectiveness of the vincristine, etoposide, and carboplatin regimen in reducing occurrence of metastasis. Their study was done in 51 post enucleation patients with HRFs. Adjuvant chemotherapy with vincristine, etoposide, and carboplatin resulted in zero metastasis during a mean follow up of 66 months.

A more recent 5-year prospective study done in 2019 by Chévez-Barrios et. al reviewed the histopathology of 321 IRSS Stage I patients from USA and India. Adjuvant chemotherapy with vincristine, etoposide, and carboplatin was given to those presenting with HRFs, while those who did not present with HRFs were subsequently observed. They reported discordance between the original versus the central histopathologic review, hence emphasizing the importance of an experienced pathologist post-enucleation. Results showed a 96% 2-year event-free survival to IRSS stage 1 patients who had HRFs and adjuvant chemotherapy while 99% 2-year event-free survival to those who did not have HRFs and were observed.

On the other hand, a study involving retinoblastoma IRSS Stage I patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) was done by Luna-Fineman et. al in 2019. Delayed enucleation and neoadjuvant chemotherapy were given to 59 out of 161 patients with buphthalmos and those perceived to be at risk for enucleation refusal and/or
---
abandonment. These two parameters are common in LMICs due to delay in diagnosis, debilitating surgery, low education and socioeconomic status, and distance from treatment facility. Two to three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with vincristine, etoposide, and carboplatin were initially given. Enucleation proceeded thereafter, then six cycles of chemotherapy was completed regardless of presence of HRFs. The remaining 102 patients underwent upfront enucleation and histopathologic review for HRFs. Results showed that the five-year abandonment-sensitive event free survival rate was 68% for patients who had delayed enucleation while 89% for those who underwent upfront enucleation. Although data showed a lower survival rate for the delayed enucleation group, the authors reported it to still be an effective strategy in LMICs since mortality due to the disease is definite if patients completely refuse or abandon treatment.

# Evidence Summary and Source of Guideline Recommendations

Adjuvant prophylactic chemotherapy was recommended by the two source guidelines from Canadian Retinoblastoma Society8 and SIOP-PODC Graduated-Intensity Retinoblastoma Guidelines13.

The source guideline for recommendation was SIOP-PODC guideline13. The guideline recommends that carboplatin-based regimens should be the first choice, including cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and doxorubicin with the possible addition of doxorubicin may be an alternative if carboplatin-based regiments not available. The recommendation was based on a Phase II trial of 20 patients with 85%; there were nine complete responses and eight partial responses. Hematologic toxicity was the only observed toxicity with the latter regimen.

The recommendations from other groups on the chemotherapy regimen for IRSS Stage 1 patients with high-risk features is shown in Table 18.

# 4.8 Among newly diagnosed IRSS stage 2 children, what is the recommended chemotherapy regimen?

# Recommendation

Among newly diagnosed IRSS stage 2 children, we recommend adjuvant systemic chemotherapy utilizing Vincristine + Etoposide + Carboplatin either alone or alternating with Cyclophosphamide and an anthracycline followed with orbital and optic nerve radiotherapy up to chiasm. (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence)

# Consensus Issues

No specific consensus issues noted.

The external reviewer shared a commentary that in some cases, radiation therapy volumes may be confined to the optic canal with an appropriate margin. This approach allows for less toxicity and sparing of the pituitary gland.

# Review Methods

A systematic search was done from September 2022 to June 2023, using international (Medline, Central, and Google Scholar) and local database, HERDIN). Unpublished studies were requested through the Steering Committee. Keywords used were a combination of MeSH and free text search with the terms “Retinoblastoma” AND “Treatment”.

# Background

IRSS Stage 2 is defined as eye enucleation with microscopic residual tumor either scleral or at cut-end of optic nerve or rupture of eye during surgery. IRSS Stage 2 and 3 are managed similarly with external-beam radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The chemotherapy regimens used by different groups composed of vincristine, etoposide, platinum agents (carboplatin, cisplatin), cyclophosphamide and anthracyclines (idarubicin, doxorubicin).

A study by Chantada et. al reported on the treatment results of patients with tumor invasion on the cut end of the optic nerve. A retrospective study was done where three different chemotherapy protocols were utilized on 26 IRSS Stage 2 and 3 patients who also underwent enucleation and radiation therapy. Protocol 1 employed a standard dose of intravenous chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and doxorubicin, followed by intrathecal therapy. On the other hand, protocols 2 and 3 both
---
received a higher dose of intravenous chemotherapy with carboplatin, and etoposide alternating with cyclophosphamide, idarubicin, and vincristine without intrathecal therapy. Protocol 3 utilized a 10% lower dose of carboplatin versus protocol 2. Results showed an overall 5-year event-free survival rate of 70%. In addition, there was no significant difference in outcomes between protocols.

A case series using another chemotherapy regimen was done by Honavar et. al in India in 2017. 63 Twenty IRSS Stage 2 patients were given 3-6 cycles of high dose vincristine, etoposide, and carboplatin, followed by enucleation or exenteration, orbital radiotherapy, then completed a total of 12 cycles of chemotherapy. After treatment, 90% of patients did not have local recurrence or systemic metastasis at a mean of 36 months follow-up. In addition, patients had an acceptable cosmetic outcome.

A more recent prospective trial by Dunkel et. al in 2022 done in USA, Argentina, Egypt, and Brazil evaluated an intensive multimodal therapy for extraocular retinoblastoma. 65 IRSS Stage 2 retinoblastoma patients were given four cycles of induction chemotherapy with vincristine, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide. Radiation therapy followed thereafter wherein the clinical target volume for stage 2 disease included the orbit. Results showed that 1-year event free survival rate and overall survival rate was 88.1%, while 3-year event free survival rate and overall survival rate was 88.1%. These data thus reflect the effectiveness of the multimodal therapy for stage 2 patients.

# Evidence Summary and Source of Guideline Recommendations

The source guideline for recommendation was SIOP-PODC guideline.13 Recommendations were based on three observational studies with one study from Central American Association of Pediatric Hematology Oncology (AHOPCA) proposed a protocol-directed therapy aimed to standardize the approach and to improve outcomes of patients with retinoblastoma with adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of vincristine, etoposide, and carboplatin.62 (See Table 19.)

# Background

IRSS Stage 3 is described as regional extension of tumor either as an overt orbital disease or with extension to the preauricular or cervical lymph node.57 IRSS Stage 2 and 3 are managed similarly with external-beam radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The chemotherapy regimens used by different groups composed of vincristine, etoposide, platinum agents (carboplatin, cisplatin), cyclophosphamide and anthracyclines (idarubicin, doxorubicin).

The preference to enucleation vs exenteration was studied by Radhakrishnan in India.66 A prospective study was done to determine the outcomes of 28 IRSS Stage 3 patients given 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with vincristine, carboplatin, and etoposide. This was proceeded by enucleation or exenteration, external-beam radiation therapy, and then 9 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with vincristine, and carboplatin. Results revealed overall survival was 40.4% and event free survival was at 33.33% at 26 months. Authors reported that all patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were enucleated successfully thereby avoiding the need for exenteration.

There were several studies who reviewed the effectivity of various chemotherapy regimens for IRSS Stage 3 patients. A prospective study done by Chawla et. al in 2016 compared two chemotherapy regimens for 54 IRSS Stage 3 patients and determined their outcomes.67 Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, enucleation, orbital external-beam radiotherapy, and followed by adjuvant chemotherapy was done for all patients. Vincristine, etoposide, and carboplatin were given to Group A patients while carboplatin and etoposide alternating with cyclophosphamide, idarubicin, and vincristine was given to Group B patients. Results showed that 1-year survival probability was 81% for group A while 79% for group B. However, the 4-year survival probability was 63% for group A while 25% for group B. These data revealed that the combination of vincristine, etoposide, and carboplatin was a more effective therapy for IRSS Stage 3 patients.

A recent prospective trial by Dunkel et. al done in 2022 in USA, Argentina, Egypt, and Brazil evaluated an intensive multimodal therapy for extraocular retinoblastoma.65 IRSS Stage 3 retinoblastoma patients were given four cycles of induction chemotherapy with vincristine, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide. Radiation therapy followed thereafter. The clinical target volume for stage 3 disease included the orbit, if stage 2 features were present, residual tumor, and regional lymph nodes after induction therapy. Results showed that 1-year event free survival rate and overall survival rate was 88.1%, while 3-year event free survival rate and overall survival rate.

was 88.1%. These data thus reflect the effectiveness of the multimodal therapy for stage 3 patients.

# Evidence Summary and Source of Guideline Recommendations

The source guideline recommendation was the SIOP-PODC guideline.13

# Recommendations

Recommendations were based on one review and two observational studies. Preferred management is multimodal with a combination of initial high-dose chemotherapy, surgery, external beam radiotherapy and prolonged chemotherapy for 12 cycles.68 According to Ali et al, observational studies have shown that systemic chemotherapy alone is unlikely to eradicate residual orbital disease, orbital exenteration alone is unlikely to achieve surgical clearance.68 External beam radiotherapy is unlikely to prevent systemic metastasis and there is histopathologic evidence of viable tumor cells present even in phthisical eyes following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The latter two observational studies recommend the regimens to use.

3. Among newly diagnosed IRSS stage 4 children with Rb tumor involving the meninges of the brain and spinal cord in setting 3, we recommend palliative treatment. (Strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)

# Consensus Issues

No specific consensus issues noted.

# Review Methods

A systematic search was done from September 2022 to June 2023, using international (Medline, Central, and Google Scholar) and local database, HERDIN).

No relevant randomized controlled trials were found during the search. Two clinical practice guidelines were included after appraisal using AGREE II Tool for ADAPTE.

# Background

IRSS Stage 4 is defined as metastatic disease via hematogenous spread (Stage 4a) or with central nervous system (CNS) extension with or without other sites of metastatic disease (Stage 4b).57

The latest management guideline for IRSS Stage 4 as presented by the Indian Council of Medical Research last 2023 stated that stage 4a patients with metastasis to bone
---
and bone marrow may be treated with curative intent.69 Use of autologous bone marrow transplant may be done depending on response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, enucleation, and radiotherapy to the orbit. On the other hand, stage 4b patients with central nervous system involvement may be treated with palliative intent which involves palliative chemotherapy, intrathecal chemotherapy, palliative radiotherapy, and best supportive care.

Similarly, the Canadian Retinoblastoma Society recommended enucleation, adjunctive chemotherapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant if with response to chemotherapy to patients with metastasis to the bone marrow, bone, or other organs or tissues.8 Meanwhile, for tumor spread to the meninges of the brain and spinal cord, palliative treatment is considered. Treatment with enucleation, adjunctive chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplant if with response to chemotherapy, and periodic intrathecal chemotherapy is given If with spread to the CSF.

The clinical practice guidelines from Peru also recommended palliative chemotherapy to patients with metastasis to the CNS.47 Meanwhile, if metastasis does not involve the CNS, neoadjuvant chemotherapy utilizing the PEVC or GALOP regimen prior to enucleation is recommended. The PEVC regimen includes vincristine, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide for a duration of 21 days. The GALOP regimen employs 4 cycles of idarubicin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide alternating with 4 cycles of etoposide, and carboplatin for a total duration of 21 days. After enucleation, adjuvant chemotherapy, and external beam radiation therapy is given.

With regards to intrathecal chemotherapy, one case report by Rodriguez et. al detailed a trial done on a 4-year-old Stage 4b patient in Argentina where a high-dose intra-arterial chemotherapy targeting the ophthalmic artery and chiasm plus intrathecal chemotherapy was done.70 Three cycles of carboplatin, melphalan, and intrathecal topotecan were employed and noted partial resolution of the orbital tumor mass and the chiasmatic lesion. In addition, there was complete resolution of tumor in the CSF. Enucleation followed and histopathology results noted complete tumor necrosis. Although the patient reported was eventually lost to follow-up post-surgery, the results of this study may be an area for further research especially on stage 4b patients.

Looking at palliative chemotherapy, a recent Children’s Oncology Trial (2022) done in USA, Argentina, Egypt, and Brazil evaluated an intensive multimodal therapy for extraocular retinoblastoma.65 IRSS Stage 4a or 4b patients were given four cycles of chemotherapy and those with more than or equal to a partial response were given one cycle of high-dose carboplatin, thiotepa, and etoposide with autologous hematopoietic stem-cell support. Radiotherapy then follows if residual tumor is present post chemotherapy. Based on the study, 1-year event free survival was at 82.6% for stage 4a, and 28.3% for stage 4b, while 3-year event free survival was at 76.7% for Stage 4a, and 14.2% for 4b. The authors noted that the regimen used was resource intensive and may not be available in most low-income countries.
---
Metronomic chemotherapy (MC) is defined as frequent and regular intake of chemotherapeutic drugs to maintain a low and active concentration at a prolonged duration without causing unnecessary toxicity.71 A randomized controlled trial was done by Pramanik et. al in India wherein the effect of metronomic therapy versus placebo on progression-free survival (PFS) in 108 pediatric patients with primary extracranial, nonhematopoietic solid malignant tumor that progressed after 2 regimens of chemotherapy was assessed.72 The diagnosis of the patients was as follows: bone sarcoma, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, esthesioneuroblastoma, non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft-tissue sarcoma, retinoblastoma, and others. The treatment arm was given a regimen including celecoxib and thalidomide alternating with etoposide and cyclophosphamide. Results showed that 100% (52/52) of the patients had disease progression in the placebo group, while 96.4% (53/56) in the MC group. In addition, the median PFS was 46 days in the placebo group while 49 days in the MC group. The overall survival was 85 days for both the placebo group and the MC group. These results indicate that MC did not improve the patients’ 6-month PFS. However, the authors noted that in a post hoc subgroup analysis, there was statistically significant increase in PFS among patients who received more than 3 cycles of chemotherapy and those who did not have a bone tumor.

# Evidence Summary and Source of Guideline Recommendations

Recommendations were based on two source guidelines, the SIOP-PODC, which highlights settings-based approach for the treatment of metastatic Rb.13 The recommendations were based on one observational study with a very small sample size of 11 wherein treatment of High-dose chemotherapy (HDC) followed by autologous stem cell rescue (ASCR) was provided as intervention. This was provided at a median of 5.7 months from the diagnosis of metastasis resulting in seven children having disease-free survival (median follow-up 39 months).

The CRS has the same recommendations with SIOP-PODC but are focused on what type of extraorbital or systemic metastatic involvement with adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by local control and consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell rescue.8 Based on one observational study, extraocular Rb treatment protocols generally include orbital radiation for orbital recurrence post-enucleation, systemic chemotherapy, stem cell/bone marrow transplant, and intrathecal chemotherapy for CNS disease with meningeal spread. Recommendations are mostly consensus based on the CRS guidelines for treatment for metastatic Rb.8

# 5. Research Implications/Gaps

In general, there is a scarcity of published guidelines and clinical trials due to the low incidence of retinoblastoma. This is particularly true for diagnostic accuracy studies involving CT scan. There is also a need to standardize the definition of high-risk pathologic features; different studies used various criteria. The small sample size of retinoblastoma patients precludes the conduct of clinical trials to determine the efficacy of different chemotherapy regimens. Finally, Annexes F to M are in this guideline to help the users of the guidelines adhere to the Rb’s comprehensive standards of care.

# 6. Dissemination and Implementation

The Retinoblastoma GDG will consider various channels to effectively disseminate the manuscript. The CPG will undergo screening by the DOH Disease Prevention and Control Bureau for recognition and implementation as a National Practice Guideline by the DOH and the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC). To target healthcare professionals, The Philippine Academy of Ophthalmology and the Philippine Society of Pediatric Oncology will disseminate the CPG, the clinical pathways and algorithms through lectures for different stakeholders in national and regional meetings. Special emphasis will be placed on the management algorithms for both unilateral (Appendix H) and bilateral disease (Appendix I), based on the recommended staging systems outlined in Appendix J, to guide clinicians in developing patient treatment plans. Additionally, Appendix K will include recommended practices for pathology reports to standardize the documentation of pathological findings, while Appendix L will feature a checklist for MRI radiology reports used in staging patients. These societies will also create spearhead the creation of a national Retinoblastoma tumor board open for all hospitals where specialists can provide expert guidance on the management of patients using the CPG algorithm and recommendations. Copies of this CPG will be distributed to other specialty societies involved in Retinoblastoma care such as the Philippine College of Radiology, Philippine Radiation Oncology Society, Philippine Society of Pathologist and the Philippine Pediatric Society.

The evidence summaries and the full CPG manuscript will be posted online in the Compendium of DOH-Approved Clinical Practice Guidelines website (https://doh.gov.ph/dpcb/doh-approved-cpg/) and on professional society websites. To target hospitals and the local government, the GDG will create a steering committee in collaboration with the Omnibus Health Guidance Team and the Sub technical Working group for childhood cancer. For hospitals, sample interventions include a list of necessary medical equipment and manpower for optimal treatment of

# Retinoblastoma and a Defined Referral Network for Complicated Cases

For the local government, it would be a coordinated referral pathway for early detection.

# Implementation of Clinical Practice Guidelines

The GDG aims to improve the effectiveness of its clinical practice guidelines by creating an implementation checklist and defining key monitoring indicators for all strong recommendations. These indicators will be established after consultations with the GDG and DOH. The Philippine Academy of Ophthalmology and the Philippine Society of Pediatric Oncology will implement annual feedback mechanisms through online surveys, email, or feedback forms to gather comments, suggestions, and experiences on the CPG. This feedback will provide valuable insights for continuous improvement and ensure alignment with clinical practice needs. The societies will also benchmark clinical patient outcomes against national and international standards to drive continuous improvement.

# 7. Applicability Issues

All recommendations are based on the best available evidence and current resources. The CPG focused on the availability, accessibility, and cost of diagnostic tests and pharmacological treatments in low- and middle-income settings, specifically the Philippines. Panel members, mostly practicing physicians, ensured the recommendations' applicability to both private and public healthcare facilities, including urban and rural areas. While most diagnostic tests are available in urban settings, pathology and ophthalmology expertise for histopathologic staging and treating retinoblastoma may be limited in some areas. As a result, the consensus panel provided recommendations for both basic and advanced retinoblastoma centers. A review of the available PhilHealth case rates for retinoblastoma diagnosis and treatment was conducted and included in the appendix.

# Facilitators and Barriers to Implementation

Facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the Retinoblastoma CPG were identified from the discussions of the multidisciplinary and multistakeholder steering and consensus panels. Facilitators mentioned included public funding support for medications and services, accessible expert consultations for second opinions on diagnosis and management, and advocacy activities on early detection. The barriers included limited PhilHealth case rate coverage for procedures, significant out-of-pocket costs for treatment and surveillance, the lack of retinoblastoma ophthalmology and pathology experts nationwide, and the unavailability of medicines and equipment, such as lasers. This information provided context for the formulation of recommendation statements for the local setting.

This CPG does not necessarily supersede the consumers’ (i.e., health professionals, hospital administrators, employers, payors, patients) values, settings, and circumstances.

# 8. Updating of the Guidelines

The Retinoblastoma Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) will undergo updates every three years, starting in 2026 or when new or major evidence from large-scale local and international studies emerge on priority topics, or when there are changes in available resources (medicine, technologies) or national policies.

The Department of Health (DOH) will periodically review the relevance and applicability of the guidelines and make updates as needed. The update process will follow the procedures outlined in the DOH Manual on Practice Guideline Development, and the GRADE approach will be used.

# Appendix F. Retinoblastoma Treatment Settings

The Pediatric Oncology in Developing Countries (PODC) Committee of the International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) has developed a classification system to categorize retinoblastoma (Rb) service delivery capacity into three distinct levels. This system is based on the availability and quality of resources across several key areas: imaging, oncology treatment, ophthalmologic care, pathology assessment, and genetic testing.

|Resource availability|Setting 1 (Basic)|Setting 2 (Intermediate)|Setting 3 (Advanced)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Imaging|Not available or CT only|CT and occasionally MRI|MRI|
|Oncology treatment|Low-dose chemotherapy, Cobalt RT|Moderate-dose chemotherapy; Cobalt RT; Linear accelerator RT|Moderate- and high-dose chemotherapy; 3D RT; autologous hematopoietic stem cell rescue linear accelerator (optional)|
|Ophthalmologic treatment|Minimal|Cryotherapy, laser therapy, EBRT|Cryotherapy; laser-TTT; EBRT (3D, IMRT); digital camera for fundoscopy; Intra-arterial chemotherapy; plaque ablation (optional)|
|Pathology assessment|Minimal, low-specialty, diagnosis confirmation|Low specialty, limited risk assessment|High-quality specialty, accurate risk assessment|
|Genetic testing|Not available|Not available|Limited availability, usually low resolution|

# Criteria for reclassification of setting

- Ophthalmologist with training in conservative therapy
- Availability of laser therapy, cryotherapy, and RT
- Safe pediatric anesthesiology
- &lt;5% mortality rate related to toxicity of chemotherapy
- Pathology assessment capable of accurate disease staging

# Appendix J. Retinoblastoma Staging Systems

The Reese–Ellsworth (RE) classification system for RB was developed in the 1960s to predict the probability of maintaining sight and control of local disease with EBRT but was not designed to predict the likelihood of metastases or patient survival. In 2005, the International Classification of Retinoblastoma (ICRB) emerged and has been shown to assist in predicting those who are likely to be cured by chemo-reduction and focal therapy. Both the RE and ICRB are for the intraocular staging of Rb. Another classification system, the International Retinoblastoma Staging System (IRSS), was proposed in 2006 which aimed to incorporate the entire spectrum of the disease (Chantada et. al, 2006). Patients were classified according to disease extent, and presence of extra-ocular extension. The AJCC/UICC10 staging system (TNM) emerged as a universal staging system for all cancers and included both intraocular and extraocular RB. The most recent revision of the AJCC/UICC staging is the eighth edition, effective for cancers diagnosed on or after January 1, 2010. This revision came after the international classification and can be used to describe the extent of RB in detail, particularly for those cases where the disease has spread outside of the eye.

# Reese–Ellsworth (RE) Classification System

|Group 1|very favorable for saving [or preserving] the eye|
|---|---|
| |● 1A: one tumor, smaller than 4-disc diameters (DD), at or behind the equator|
| |● 1B: multiple tumors smaller than 4 DD, all at or behind the equator|
|Group 2|favorable for saving [or preserving] the eye|
| |● 2A: one tumor, 4 to 10 DD, at or behind the equator|
| |● 2B: multiple tumors, with at least one 4 to 10 DD, and all at or behind the equator|
|Group 3|doubtful for saving [or preserving] the eye|
| |● 3A: any tumor in front of the equator|
| |● 3B: one tumor, larger than 10 DD, behind the equator|
|Group 4|unfavorable for saving [or preserving] the eye|
| |● 4A: multiple tumors, some larger than 10 DD|
| |● 4B: any tumor extending toward the front of the eye to the ora serrata (front edge of the retina)|
|Group 5|very unfavorable for saving [or preserving] the eye|
| |● 5A: tumors involving more than half of the retina|
| |● 5B: vitreous seeding (spread of tumors into the jelly-like material that fills the eye)|

# Appendix K. Retinoblastoma Pathology Reporting

# Synoptic Reporting

All core and conditionally required data elements outlined on the surgical case summary from this cancer protocol must be displayed in synoptic report format. Synoptic format is defined as:

- Data element: followed by its answer (response), outline format without the paired Data element: Response format is NOT considered synoptic.
- The data element should be represented in the report as it is listed in the case summary. The response for any data element may be modified from those listed in the case summary, including “Cannot be determined” if appropriate.
- Each diagnostic parameter pair (Data element: Response) is listed on a separate line or in a tabular format to achieve visual separation. The following exceptions are allowed to be listed on one line:
- Anatomic site or specimen, laterality, and procedure
- Pathologic Stage Classification (pTNM) elements
- Negative margins, as long as all negative margins are specifically enumerated where applicable
- The synoptic portion of the report can appear in the diagnosis section of the pathology report, at the end of the report or in a separate section, but all Data element: Responses must be listed together in one location

Note:

External reviewer shared that the determination of tumor site in the specimen at the pathology laboratory using transillumination may have some practicality concerns.
